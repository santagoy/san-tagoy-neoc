Initiative
Roll a d20 for each individual or group involved in the combat. Write these down and resolve, highest first.
Do this at the beginning of each Round. A Round is an innumerably fast amount of time. A single moment between life and death.
If you&rsquo;ve caught your opponents by surprise, you all shoot first and resolve Initiative after the players&rsquo; turns."><title>Wanton Pinoy Spaghetti: Violence

Write these down and resolve, highest first.</p><p>Do this at the beginning of each Round. A Round is an innumerably fast amount of time. A single moment between life and death.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve caught your opponents by surprise, you all shoot first and resolve Initiative after the players&rsquo; turns.</p><blockquote><p>Groups can be used for larger scale actions involving, for example, 3&ndash;4 bands per “side” of a conflict.</p></blockquote><h2 id=shooting>Shooting</h2><p>To shoot someone, anyone, in a gunfight, roll 16+ on a d20. If they&rsquo;re not in cover or moving, roll with Advantage. If firing multiple shots, add +1 per additional shot. Add relevant Tags. Resolve who gets shot: player chooses or we roll randomly.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve shot someone, roll another d20:</p><ul><li><p>Add +2 to the roll for each Injury they have.</p></li><li><p>Revolver calibers add +2 to this roll.</p></li><li><p>Hunting rounds, military calibers, and shotgun slugs add +4 to this roll.</p></li><li><p>Buckshot adds +5 at close ranges and +2 at medium.</p></li></ul><p>If the result is 10+, they go Down. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re Injured.</p><h2 id=down>Down</h2><p>After the violence is concluded, roll a d20 for each person Down. Add +2 for each Injury. On a 10+, they&rsquo;re dead. Otherwise, they&rsquo;re Critically Injured and die without medical attention.</p><h2 id=sniping>Sniping</h2><p>To snipe, you must be at a distance. The target must also be unaware of your position and be either not in cover or not moving. You hit the first target automatically if you meet all prior conditions (i.e. distance, surprise, and stillness). You hit succeeding targets on a 12+ if 2/3 of the conditions are met. If only 1 is met, follow regular shooting rules.</p><p>On a hit, roll for if they&rsquo;re Downed or Injured.</p><h2 id=melee>Melee</h2><p>Both combatants roll a d12 and add relevant modifiers. Announce if intent is to subdue or to kill.</p><ul><li><p>If the difference between them is 1 or 0, both are Injured and the fight continues.</p></li><li><p>If the difference is 2&ndash;3, the high-scorer is Injured. The low-scorer is Injured and goes Down.</p></li><li><p>If the difference is 4+, the low-scored is Injured and goes Down.</p></li></ul><p>A sword, axe, spear, or other weapon that increases your reach would add +3. A shorter ranged weapon adds +2. Relevant Tags add +2 as always.</p><p>If Melee is initiated during a round, both combatants have their turns consumed until one goes Down.</p><h2 id=suppression>Suppression</h2><p>When firing to suppress, no roll is required.</p><p>When a suppressed target takes an action which could expose them, roll 1d6. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number of people firing to suppress, the target is shot. The number rolled is how many individuals hit—resolve each separately, determining randomly who hits.</p><p>If Suppression is at hidden or obscured targets, it only has half effect (i.e. 2 people would have to fire to have a 1-in-6 chance of shooting individuals as they act).</p><h2 id=reloading>Reloading</h2><p>Account for every shot. Revolvers usually have 6 shots. Lever-actions, about 9 or 14 on average, more rounds makes for a longer gun.</p><p>Coach guns only fire 2 shots. Single-shot rifle, only 1. Bolt-action rifles? 5 shots.</p><p>Reloading takes a round. Although, anything with the <code>quick reload</code> Tag reloads freely once per round after firing so that you may shoot again.</p><p>An example would be the coach gun being able to fire 4 shots in a single round or a revolver with a speed loader fires 12 rounds total.</p><h2 id=healing>Healing</h2><p>When you take an Injury and happen to survive, you must spend a week resting in a safe place per injury to heal. 3 injuries means 3 weeks for example.</p><p>After 3 days upon receiving Injuries, you may move around and act in a debilitated capacity. You, however, retain those Injuries until you heal.</p><h2 id=enemy-morale>Enemy Morale</h2><p>Assign a morale rating to a general group of enemies from 3 to 9. The higher, the less likely to rout.</p><p>Roll 2d6 when their</p><ul><li><p>leader is shot</p></li><li><p>numbers are halved</p></li></ul><p>If the result exceeds the sum of their total morale, they flee or surrender.</p><p>Players&rsquo; prerogative on when their characters fold.</p></article><hr></div></main></body></html>
