      <description>The fastest way to make a character.&#xA;Think of a character concept. Who are they in this time in history? A foreigner? A local? Regardless, they (and now by extension you) are in consistent company with a group of companions.&#xA;These companions are the other players (their characters) at the table. Think of how you all know each other in the world. Why are you as thick as thieves? Are you thieves?</description>

      <description>Basic Assumptions&#xD;#&#xD;This is a more involved way of making a character. I do find this method generally more enjoyable if the point is to not make disposable characters.&#xA;Your character begins at 18 years of age, untrained and inexperienced. By the end of character creation, you&amp;rsquo;re assumed to have either retired from your career in pursuit of other goals or began traveling while still practicing your preferred profession.</description>

      <title>Wanton Pinoy Spaghetti: Violence</title>

      <description>Based on Luke Gearing&amp;rsquo;s Violence!&#xA;Initiative&#xD;#&#xD;Roll a d20 for each individual or group involved in the combat. Write these down and resolve, highest first.&#xA;Do this at the beginning of each Round. A Round is an innumerably fast amount of time. A single moment between life and death.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;ve caught your opponents by surprise, you all shoot first and resolve Initiative after the players&amp;rsquo; turns.&#xA;Groups can be used for larger scale actions involving, for example, 3&amp;ndash;4 bands per “side” of a conflict.</description>
