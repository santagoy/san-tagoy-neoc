I don&rsquo;t want to make a new system or intimidate newbies with B/X. Plus I didn&rsquo;t want a setting exposition dump. The solution was Troika! And, yes, I ripped the characters from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2. Then I made them into more specific backgrounds for this post. The Force even has an analog here.</p><p>The reason was that after playing Dogs in the Vineyard, I wanted to make a setting inspired by it in the post-apocalypse. So I came up with Pigs in the Graveyard. I wanted to develop over time, but now I think the best way to build the world is with Troika. Yay!</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be running <a href=https://san-tagoy.itch.io/smells-fishy-jack>Smells Fishy, Jack!</a>. Players, don&rsquo;t click if you want to avoid all spoilers.

The Order of Readers graced you with their ordainment and that opportunity went out like a candle. Roaming the What-was Wastes is a lonely endeavor. Chin up, you&rsquo;ll find friends one day.</p><h3 id=possessions>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>a soldier&rsquo;s rifle* ripped from a stiff corpse</li><li>entrenchment tool from the same dead dude</li><li>a stolen gas mask</li><li>A vice flask with a homemade concoction.

Now, nearing extinction, you teach literacy to anyone in the hopes that one hears the Echo. They better listen, you bear mystic arms.</p><h3 id=possessions-1>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>a big iron, 6 shots, damage as pistolet, and only fires in your hand</li><li>4 crystal sacraments, atomic edged glass blades (ignores armor, damage as sword)</li><li>heavily annotated historical texts on their ecclesiastic e-readers</li><li>8 silent veils, sheer black handkerchiefs to anoint the dead or soon-to-be</li></ul><h3 id=advanced-skills-1>ADVANCED SKILLS</h3><ul><li>3 Teaching (choose pedagogy or andragogy)</li><li>3 Power—Guiding Words</li><li>2 Medicine OR 2 Engineering</li><li>2 Blade-fighting</li><li>2 Science (choose field)</li><li>1 Athletics</li><li>1 Gun Fighting</li><li>0 Common Sense</li></ul><h3 id=special-1>SPECIAL</h3><p>You perceive the Echo. A phenomenon emerged from the Pride and Fall. Did the bombs unleash what was always there or were our ancestors witness to its conception?</p><p>Manifest psychic premonitions of danger or other significant events. Divine nebulous, but correct answers to problems after 15 minutes in uninterrupted meditation. Your body is a temple fortress reinforced by your attunement: regardless of what you are wearing, you always have light armor.</p><h4 id=guiding-words-1>GUIDING WORDS (1)</h4><p>Speak a plainly stated command. Roll Versus. On a success, the target follows your words to the spirit. Otherwise, they gain a migraine and, if familiar with it, become aware of the power.</p><hr><h2 id=13-highly-literate-exile>13 HIGHLY LITERATE EXILE</h2><p>You&rsquo;d spill blood again. Waging war to save others is where you excel, General.

Killing became a sport to this sadistic you. You never ran out of &ldquo;enemies.&rdquo; Yet, when one wished to save you, their empathy broke you. Deserter! Running away is a slower death. Letting your savior die, an unforgivable sin.</p><h3 id=possessions-3>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>flagellation scars from training</li><li>a pendant touched by The Echo, heightening your &ldquo;sense&rdquo; (+1 to max luck while in possession)</li><li>a crafted macuahuitl grafted with artificial obsidian, crystals play a discordant tune as it&rsquo;s swung (ignores armor, damage as Greatsword)</li><li>2d6 doses of phlogi-tonic.

You always have light armor.</p><hr><h2 id=22-soldierly-technician>22 SOLDIERLY TECHNICIAN</h2><p>You choosing to become death, destroyer of worlds still echoes in your heart. The General&rsquo;s orders were clear and you had always wanted revenge. Though you died that day you decided to kill. Now wandering What-was, you help others but don&rsquo;t even save yourself.</p><h3 id=possessions-4>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>Uranium glass capacitor necklace</li><li>A rarely used journal embossed with &ldquo;Mors Ab Alto&rdquo;</li><li>a War Boar stun baton you restored when you were younger</li></ul><h3 id=advanced-skills-4>ADVANCED SKILLS</h3><ul><li>4 Engineering</li><li>4 Science—Nuclear Physics</li><li>3 Computers</li><li>2 Gun Fighting</li><li>2 Athletics</li></ul><h3 id=special-4>SPECIAL</h3><p>You are tougher than most, you always have light armor on.

You have a gut feeling before danger strikes.</p><hr><h2 id=23-war-boarman-mercenary>23 WAR BOARMAN MERCENARY</h2><p>Your people survived after the Pride and Fall through the domestication of kaboars, mutated beasts of burden. A century later, Ordo Tona of your clan invented kargadenza, the bio-fuel. The tradition of nomadic caravans driven by these two traditions survives. Your peoples&rsquo; attempted conquering of What-was still scars many too.</p><h3 id=possessions-5>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>Bedu, a loyal kaboar and friend that heeds your every order</li><li>a spear (ignores armor, damage as spear), its head is a crystal sacrament taken from a Reader you killed in the war</li><li>2d6 volatile phlogitonic grenades*, your own invention</li><li>mobile lab equipment</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>DAMAGE ROLL</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>*Phlogitonic Grenades</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=advanced-skills-5>ADVANCED SKILLS</h3><ul><li>4 Riding</li><li>3 Gun Fighting</li><li>3 Melee Fighting</li><li>3 Athletics</li><li>2 Science - Chemistry</li><li>2 Vehicle Mechanics</li><li>2 Driving</li></ul><hr><p><img src=/img/pitg-d33-backgrounds/robot-stairs.webp alt="hero image"></p><h2 id=31-blind-seer>31 BLIND SEER</h2><p>Your people, all born without sight, truly see through The Echo. Your true-sight didn&rsquo;t spare you from the wrath of the Pigs. As the last of them, you were paraded as a mascot of mercy by your family&rsquo;s murderers. You left that prison soaked in your jailers&rsquo; blood.</p><h3 id=possessions-6>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>a braid of petrified fingers, one from each Pig you killed and one from the one you hunt</li><li>a stolen saber made from red obsidian, it hums a tune with every strike (ignores armor)</li><li>a bastardized ritual mask from a dead Pig</li></ul><h3 id=advanced-skills-6>ADVANCED SKILLS</h3><ul><li>4 Saber Fighting</li><li>3 Power—Echo Sight</li><li>3 Athletics</li><li>2 Stealth</li><li>1 Thieving</li></ul><h3 id=special-5>SPECIAL</h3><p>All your people attune to the Echo. You always have light armor and sense danger before it happens. They&rsquo;re also famous for their mystic song that heals or bolsters. When singing you or one ally regains 1d6 stamina whenever you spend a whole turn singing. Or give one ally +2 to a contested roll or +1 to a damage roll.</p><p>However, you&rsquo;ve felt the call of The Howl and have let it surge through you once. You could call upon it again When you do, you sing at a frequency subtle enough to create unstable resonances that rend molecules apart. All who hear this take damage as below*. Roll luck too. On a failure, allies receive the same damage. If you choose to not roll luck, gain +1 to the damage roll.</p><table><thead><tr><th>DAMAGE ROLL</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7+</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>*Howling Hymn</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>22</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=echo-sight-0-or-1>ECHO SIGHT (0 or 1)</h4><p>You sense people through walls even without activating the power. You always know where people are, regardless of distance for as long as you have anything of theirs. Spend 1 stamina to sense a thread of future outcomes for any action.</p><hr><h2 id=32-braino-3000>32 BRAINO 3000</h2><p>The new worker replacement series meant to thwart the efforts of workers&rsquo; rights even before the Pride and Fall. Under new rulers, your kind are servants for the warlords of What-was. As part of secret experimental batch 3000, you excel at deadlier tasks. Once the bombs fell, your assassination protocols remained but your brothers and sisters didn&rsquo;t.</p><h3 id=possessions-7>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>duraplate chassis (as medium armor)</li><li>pain matrix emitter, transmits visible waves that only targets a meatbag&rsquo;s (any organic being) pain receptors without visible marks or harm done to the target</li><li>concealed arm-spike</li><li>jump jets</li><li>incomplete location data of a secret Braino 3000 factory</li></ul><h3 id=advanced-skills-7>ADVANCED SKILLS</h3><ul><li>4 Gun Fighting or Sniping</li><li>3 Melee Fighting</li><li>3 Agile Servomotors</li><li>2 Adaptive Translation Software</li><li>2 Military History</li><li>2 Computers</li></ul><hr><h2 id=33-tragic-self-liberated-slave>33 TRAGIC SELF-LIBERATED SLAVE</h2><p>Saved by a slaver who kept you alive but ruined you. The life-debt your tribe holds so dear tarnished by an irredeemable evil. You killed them all to see your family again. Having escaped bondage, you expected a hero&rsquo;s return. Then the elders banished you for having murdered those you owed a life-debt. You accepted your fate, which is why you slaughtered everyone you could overnight and set the village ablaze.</p><h3 id=possessions-8>POSSESSIONS</h3><ul><li>The shrunken heads of the elders who wronged you</li><li>a collection of petrified slaver tongues</li><li>The traditional Colt M16 of your people (damage as rifle)</li></ul><h3 id=advanced-skills-8>ADVANCED SKILLS</h3><ul><li>4 Survival</li><li>4 Strength and Agility</li><li>3 Awareness</li><li>3 Gun Fighting</li><li>2 Melee Fighting</li><li>2 Demolitions</li><li>1 Riding</li></ul></article></div></main></body></section></html>
