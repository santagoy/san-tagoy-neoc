   <meta name="description" content="Something I wrote about past mistakes, the burden of memory, and an epiphany brought about by good company.

Remember when I was young? I rather
not. The sins from then still stain
the once ivory light I shine. Bright,
unyielding naivete colored those movements.
Wherever I went, my shadows inflicted pain,
undeservingly—

I am not asking for contrition, Father.
I am unworthy, but I fetch a good price
in the market. The one online where
we&#39;re always shouting. Listening
to this plague of intrusive broadcasts
is the penance already. I can leave it?
Where else am I to shill?

I didn&#39;t have to back then, and yet I did.
The retrospect churns my insides. It hits
me in the soft, fleshy mass of conscience
I apparently had. I&#39;ve been had.

Yes, I know I&#39;m loved, but not by Him.
Them, yes. They&#39;re nice—real even. Who am I
to deny charity. The gift horse&#39;s mouth?
Bliss ends when ignorance is cured. I rather not
advertise? I ain&#39;t selling anything. I don&#39;t
yell in Divisoria. I&#39;ve only been there once.

It&#39;s not a transaction? Thank God. I should
thank them for that. I owe them. They
deserve better. Although, I am better.

Looking back, The shadows cast
by my once ivory light in the dark
allegorical cave were only for
my entertainment. I looked back when
the momentum was forward.

There is no Icarus. I choose to be
under the sun, even if it burns. I am not alone,
even if sometimes I am. Now, especially, there
are no longer
undeserved shadows.
