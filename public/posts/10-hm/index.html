<h2 id="this-is">This Is</h2>
<p><a href="https://san-tagoy.itch.io/ten-hail-marys-in-the-dark">It&rsquo;s an adventure</a> originally by Roz Leahy. You can find it in the <a href="https://magical-banquet-club.itch.io/violence-jam-fuck-war">Violence Jam (2022)</a>. I could really feel the wretched parallels between the setting of their work, Ireland, and my home country.</p>
<p>The Church is a bit of a mixed bag here in that they&rsquo;ve been both a source of humanity and abetted in depravity. Even with the separation of Church and State, power corrupts both. So, I wrote an adventure about it in a setting akin to Twilight 2000.</p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t have the patience to make a full PDF for something that I&rsquo;m offering for practically free as a Pay What You Want work on itch.</p>
<h2 id="its-status">Its Status</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t earned a single penny since uploading it. That&rsquo;s honestly what I expected as an unkown quantity in the scene. That&rsquo;s honestly fine with me since I just wanted Roz&rsquo;s ideas to propagate. They deserved that and so much more.</p>
<h2 id="why-again">Why Again?</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like finagling with PDFs as someone with out a tablet Sure, they&rsquo;re pretty and can easily transition to print. Does my third world self have the funds to do a massive print run for this unedited work? No. Therefore, until someone offers (or until I pitch), a pdf won&rsquo;t really surface anytime soon.</p>
<p>I just like creating things and this was a good exercise. I even made sure that the itch.io page was really pretty and to my liking. I hope to make more things like this and distribute them in a similar model as well. I hope we can make more good things without adhering to the dogma of PDFs or bust.</p>
<p>I would like web versions of things I find unreadable as a PDF on a screen. Don&rsquo;t knock it till you&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>
