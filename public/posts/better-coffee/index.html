<h1 class="content-title">Better Coffee, a Practice Poem</h1></section>

  

  <section><p>I wrote this in another place originally, but I feel as if I wanted it to be better so I&rsquo;m reposting the re-written version here on this blog. I say I wrote this on a whim, but that&rsquo;s not entirely true. I read a bad poem and was inspired to write again. Did I think I could write something better? No, I just thought that I should get better. Enjoy?</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext"><span style="display:flex;"><span>I was persistently a stranger, perplexingly so, to you whom I preferred.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>That wasn&#39;t great because whenever you asked about myself
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>It was after I&#39;d done something bad and it happened to be my fault.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Worst of all, coffee would taste undeservingly bitter as if
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I were being punished. I really should have stopped counting
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>my comeuppances, the direct results of my shortcomings,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>and my attempts at getting better without really trying.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I shouldn&#39;t have forgotten to count the times you willingly talked to me.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Sailing conversation amidst a vague tension leads to places and we explored
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>those locales like adolescents in a car on a Friday night. The saccharine air
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>of your locus was interesting in that, now, I only vaguely recall
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      the delight it (presumably) mutually stirred.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Providing something contrary to what either wanted is what it was.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I bore shields that spoke of nothing profound about myself
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>for a considerable length. You became an obligation. Things got old, like sin,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>and my sins were borne on my soul to the point of your apparent boredom.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>I can&#39;t blame you. Maybe the fruit of retrospect is that I exonerate myself too.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Still, these lamentations aren&#39;t exciting in the adventurous sort of way.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Danger was evidently not in any of my names, something
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      you&#39;ve hopefully crossed out on a list.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>A hope you&#39;re worth certainly. Coveting doesn&#39;t
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>suit me. I wouldn&#39;t love it if we had made it.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Fortunately, I made it off with this:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      I am at least now someone who,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      unlike that self in that one nightmare
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      after a day or two of forgetting my meds,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>      now has better coffee.
