      <description>Something I wrote about past mistakes, the burden of memory, and an epiphany brought about by good company.&#xA;Remember when I was young? I rather not. The sins from then still stain the once ivory light I shine. Bright, unyielding naivete colored those movements. Wherever I went, my shadows inflicted pain, undeservinglyâ€” I am not asking for contrition, Father. I am unworthy, but I fetch a good price in the market.</description>
