Introduction

</h2>
<p>The world has been properly ruined by war. Here I thought the turn of the decade would mean progress, humanity&rsquo;s inviolable ascent to greater heights. Now, think of humanity&rsquo;s annihilation albeit slower, but just as inevitable as many expected. Yet we still have landlords.</p>
<p>Welcome to the lands of the Archipelago, ruled by fiefdoms and disparate groups of fighters holding on to their ideals in a world beyond hope. That&rsquo;s a lie, as there is a modicum of hope left beyond just survival. No matter how naïve, many believe that there is a place beyond this wanton violence. This devastation was bequeathed onto us by greater powers. To those greater powers: kindly rot in hell—not that here is any better.</p>
