    <h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>Set in a speculative very near future where our mode of technology isn&rsquo;t too different from today.</p>
<p>Yes, this is effectively a not-so-subtle nod to Twilight 2000 and The Country by Luke Gearing.</p>
<p>Yes, this is also based on a hypothetical future for my home country but in parts of it more familiar to me. Yes, this was kind of depressing to write. No, I&rsquo;m not always this cynical.</p>
<h2 id="content-warning">Content Warning</h2>
<p>The following sections, particularly in <a href="/land-to-blood/chargen">character creation</a> contain fictional details about the horrors of war with few moments of light scattered here and there. Reader discretion is preferred.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The world has been properly ruined by war. Here I thought the turn of the decade would mean progress, humanity&rsquo;s inviolable ascent to greater heights. Now, think of humanity&rsquo;s annihilation albeit slower, but just as inevitable as many expected. Yet we still have landlords.</p>
<p>Welcome to the lands of the Archipelago, ruled by fiefdoms and disparate groups of fighters holding on to their ideals in a world beyond hope. That&rsquo;s a lie, as there is a modicum of hope left beyond just survival. No matter how naïve, many believe that there is a place beyond this wanton violence. This devastation was bequeathed onto us by greater powers. To those greater powers: kindly rot in hell—not that here is any better.</p>
