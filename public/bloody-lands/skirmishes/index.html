These rules were heavily inspired by what&rsquo;s there.</p><hr><h2 id=selective-use>Selective Use</h2><p>Single rolls or just saying what happens are enough to resolve most conflicts. For more complex scenarios, use these combat rules.</p><h2 id=rounds>Rounds</h2><p>Combat is divided into rounds. Each round being a flash of time. Each character commits to only one action per round. Resolve actions in the following order:</p><ol><li>Movement</li><li>Shooting</li><li>Grenades</li><li>Melee</li><li>Miscellaneous</li></ol><p>Moving and speaking are free actions. Communicate at any point in a round, though verbosity consumes an action. Players decide their action as the referee calls and resolves each phase. All characters committing to the same action perform it simultaneously.</p><h2 id=ambushes>Ambushes</h2><p>Ambushers gain a surprise round. Commit to 1 action without enemy reprisals. Additionally, roll with Advantage for any skill rolls.</p><h2 id=attacks-and-damage>Attacks and Damage</h2><p>Roll 2d6 + relevant Skills, like shooting for example. Usually, NPCs don&rsquo;t have Skills to add. If the result is 8 or higher, the attack hits. The lower die result determines hit location while the higher is the damage dealt.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Lower Attack Die</th><th style=text-align:center>Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>1&ndash;2</td><td style=text-align:center>Leg</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>3</td><td style=text-align:center>Arm</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>4&ndash;5</td><td style=text-align:center>Torso</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>6</td><td style=text-align:center>Head</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Once the combined total of damage taken is 6 or greater, the target is out of combat. They need medical intervention to survive.</p><p>Should damage in any of the hit locations reach 6 or greater, consult the following:</p><ul><li>Head: dead.</li><li>Torso: mortal wound. Death in 1d4 hours without stabilizing medical attention.</li><li>Legs or arms: A limb is destroyed. Throw! Heads for the right, tails for the left.</li></ul><p>Use luck to reduce the damage of incoming attacks too—1 point of luck to 1 point of damage. Attacks reduced to 0 this way are avoided completely.</p><p>Replace armor once it prevents its maximum number of hits in an intended location. The cost for such is listed in Gear. Armor instantly breaks when hit by anti-materiel rifles, plasma casters, and heavy artillery.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re hit by a projectile while wearing intact armor, lose your turn next round as you are forced to hunker down and catch your breathe.</p><h2 id=tracking-ammo>Tracking Ammo</h2><p>Track every shot, every bullet. Ammo is everything in a world of fully realized scarcity. When your magazine is out of ammo, spend a Miscellaneous action to reload.</p><h2 id=automatic-fire>Automatic Fire</h2><p>Automatic weapons consume more ammunition when firing in bursts, but greater chance to hit and damage. Consume 6 shots, but roll with Advantage and +2 to the damage die. However, roll with Disadvantage if you fire an Automatic weapon without the Shooting Skill.</p><h2 id=character-actions>Character Actions</h2><h3 id=movement>Movement</h3><p>Run (hopefully to cover) up to 10 meters over open ground. Obstacles or impeding terrain reduce that to 6 meters. If using minis on a table, each meter scales to 1 cm.</p><h3 id=shooting>Shooting</h3><p>Or shoot targets within range, even if they&rsquo;re moving. Advantage is rolling 3d6 and taking the two highest. Disadvantage is rolling 3d6 and taking the two lowest. Shooting beyond the maximum range is a guaranteed miss.</p><h4 id=weapon-range-limits>Weapon Range Limits</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Weapon</th><th style=text-align:center>Short (10m)</th><th style=text-align:center>Medium (30m)</th><th style=text-align:center>Long (200m)</th><th style=text-align:center>Distant (1km)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>Pistol/Revolver</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Miss</td><td style=text-align:center>Miss</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Shotgun</td><td style=text-align:center>Advantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Miss</td><td style=text-align:center>Miss</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Sub-machine Gun</td><td style=text-align:center>Advantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Miss</td><td style=text-align:center>Miss</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Assault Rifle</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Hunting Rifle</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Advantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Designated Marksman Rifle</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Advantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Anti-Materiel Rifle</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Advantage</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Grenade Launcher</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Normal</td><td style=text-align:center>Disadvantage</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id=cover-and-movement>Cover and Movement</h4><p>Roll with Disadvantage against targets in cover. If you have Advantage due to range bonuses or other factors, roll normally.</p><p>Roll with Advantage against stationary targets out of cover. If you have Disadvantage against those same targets for whatever reason, roll normally.</p><p>If shooting after moving, roll with Disadvantage.</p><p>If you forfeit your action in a round while in cover, no one has line of sight to shoot you. You are hunkering down. This only applies if opponents aren&rsquo;t flanking.</p><h3 id=grenades>Grenades</h3><h4 id=fragmentation-and-high-explosive>Fragmentation and High Explosive</h4><p>When you choose to throw a grenade, cook it. It detonates at the end of the round. Roll 2d6 + Athletics, on a hit, the grenade is able to reach its intended location. On a failure, the grenade harmlessly detonates elsewhere.</p><p>The opponent must commit a miscellaneous action to throw the grenade elsewhere out of range. Otherwise, those within short range and not behind cover must roll 2d6 + their Athletics. On a failure, they take the full hit. On a success, they avoid the damage, but they can&rsquo;t shoot next round.</p><p>For players, spend 2 Luck and roll 2d6 + Athletics to throw back the grenade. On a success, the enemy must roll to avoid the hit too. On a failure, the grenade detonates out of range of anyone.</p><h4 id=flashbang>Flashbang</h4><p>Roll 2d6 + Athletics. On a hit, the grenade detonates immediately. Enemies must roll 2d6 + their Athletics to shield their eyes. If they&rsquo;re not wearing ear protection and they fail the roll, they forfeit a round.</p><h4 id=smoke>Smoke</h4><p>Lightly obscures targets, but only imposes Disadvantage on attacks indoors.</p><h4 id=tear-gas>Tear Gas</h4><p>Roll 2d6 + Athletics to cook then throw. On a hit, all targets within 10m cough and cry uncontrollably and are practically incapacitated, unable to shoot, unless they wear a full-faced gas mask.</p><h3 id=melee>Melee</h3><p>Melee is simultaneous. Fighters with short weapons are only at an Advantage against those unarmed and have Disadvantage against weapons with reach. Medium weapons (e.g. clubs and swords) are at a Disadvantage against longer-reaching weapons (e.g spears and other polearms).</p><h3 id=miscellaneous>Miscellaneous</h3><p>Operate machinery, drive a vehicle, perform first aid on someone seriously wounded, or reload. Throwing grenades away or back fall under this action too.</p><p>If you aim, roll with Advantage when you shoot next round.</p></article><hr></div></main></body></html>
