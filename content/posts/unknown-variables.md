## This Is

A rules set for running Mothership modules or melonbread's Delta Green adventures. I wanted to hack Liminal Horror for sci-fi and remedy the parts I didn't like about it with Luke Gearing's Violence. I also plan to include a sci-fi gear list in a separate article at some point in time for use with said Mothership adventures.

## Making a Character

### Attributes

Roll 3d6, dropping the lowest die, to generate numbers for the following:

Thews adds to attack rolls. For feats of physical ability.

Wits modifies initiative. A general measure of your aptitude and speed of thought.

Control is your general likelihood to withstand stress and survive the strange.

Test for risky endeavors and avoiding dangerous consequences with 1d20 rolls. Add a single attribute to all 1d20 rolls. If the total is equal to 20 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail.

At times, you roll with fortune and misfortune. Roll 2d20 and take the higher roll if with fortune. If misfortune, the lower roll. When misfortune and fortune are applied to the same roll, roll normally.

### Hit Points

You can handle a total of three injuries before passing out and needing immediate medical attention. The fourth injury and beyond is critical damage. Make a Thews save. On a success, you survive, but will die within the hour without aid. Otherwise, make a new character.

### Skills

Roll 1d4, you have as many skills as the result. Skills add +3 or fortune to your attribute test rolls when applicable. Most cases, if you're not under duress or immense pressure, you'll succeed at the task by just having the relevant skill and the right tools.

| 1d12 | Skills            |
|:----:|:------------------|
| 1    | Bureacracy        |
| 2    | Pickpocket        |
| 3    | Medicine          |
| 4    | Brawn             |
| 5    | Shooting          |
| 6    | Jury Rigging      |
| 7    | Black Hat         |
| 8    | Light-footed      |
| 9    | Advanced Sciences |
| 10   | Piloting          |
| 11   | Driving           |
| 12   | Good with Animals |

### Hold, Stress, and Panicking

You begin with 1d10 maximum Hold per adventure/assignment. This is your mind's defense against the absurd and horrific.

Harrowing experiences inflict stress (ranges from 1d2 to 1d8) which damages hold. When Hold goes below zero, substract from your Control with the remaining stress. Then make a Control save to avoid panicking. On a failure, roll on the table below (or choose anything except adrenaline rush).

| 1d6 | Panic Effect                                                                                                      |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Adrenaline rush. Always roll with fortune for the next 1d10 minutes. Afterwards, gain two fatigue.                |
| 2-3 | Flee, regardless of who you're leaving behind.                                                                    |
| 4-5 | Charge straight into danger and attack whatever threat is closest, regardless of personal risk or threat to life. |
| 6   | Paralyzed with fear. You're now a deer in headlights.                                                             |

#### Regaining Hold

You need a full night's worth of rest away from the horrors to regain 1d6 worth of Hold. If after the 2nd night of rest you're still not back to your maximum, you need a month's worth of therapy to process things.

### Inventory and Gear

For modern adventures, you begin with a standard issue firearm and the badge denoting you as a member of a relevant agency (it changes per mission). You have whatever else you can carry with you. Choose what you think would be useful for the assignment.

## Violence

### Initiative

Roll a d20 for each individual or group involved in the combat. Write these down and resolve, highest first.

Do this at the beginning of each Round. A Round is an innumerably fast amount of time. A single moment between life and death.

If you've caught your opponents by surprise, you all shoot first and resolve initiative after the players' turns. If you are ambushed, the NPCs shoot first and initiative is resolved after their initial turns.

`Groups can be used for larger scale actions involving, for example, 3--4 bands per “side” of a conflict.`

### Shooting

To shoot someone, anyone, in a gunfight, roll 16+ on a d20. The Firearms skill adds +3 to the roll only. If they're not in cover or moving, roll with fortune. If firing multiple shots, add +1 per additional shot. Resolve who gets shot: player chooses or we roll randomly.

If you've shot someone, roll another d20:

- Add +2 to the roll for each injury they have.

- Revolver and pistol calibers add +2 to this roll.

- Rifle rounds and shotgun slugs add +4 to this roll.

- Buckshot adds +5 at close ranges and +2 at medium.

If the result is 10+, they go Down. Otherwise, they're Injured.

### Down

After the violence is concluded, roll a d20 for each person Down. Add +2 for each Injury. On a 10+, they're dead. Otherwise, they're Critically Injured and die without medical attention.

### Sniping

To snipe, you must be at a distance. The target must also be unaware of your position and be either not in cover or not moving. You hit the first target automatically if you meet all prior conditions (i.e. distance, surprise, and stillness). You hit succeeding targets on a 12+ if 2/3 of the conditions are met. If only 1 is met, follow regular shooting rules.

On a hit, roll for if they're downed or just injured.

### Melee

Both combatants roll a d12 and add relevant modifiers. Announce if intent is to subdue or to kill.

- If the difference between them is 1 or 0, both are injured and the fight continues.

- If the difference is 2--3, the high-scorer is Injured. The low-scorer is injured and goes down.

- If the difference is 4+, the low-scored is injured and goes down.

A sword, axe, spear, or other weapon that increases your reach would add +3. A shorter ranged weapon adds +2. Relevant Tags add +2 as always.

If Melee is initiated during a round, both combatants have their turns consumed until one goes Down.

### Suppression

When firing to suppress, no roll is required.

When a suppressed target takes an action which could expose them, roll 1d6. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the number of people firing to suppress, the target is shot. The number rolled is how many individuals hit—resolve each separately, determining randomly who hits.

If Suppression is at hidden or obscured targets, it only has half effect (i.e. 2 people would have to fire to have a 1-in-6 chance of shooting individuals as they act).

### Reloading

Account for every shot. Revolvers usually have 6 shots. Lever-actions, about 9 or 14 on average, more rounds makes for a longer gun.

Coach guns only fire 2 shots. Single-shot rifle, only 1. Bolt-action rifles? 5 shots.

Reloading takes a round. Although, anything with the `quick reload` Tag reloads freely once per round after firing so that you may shoot again.

### Healing

When you take an injury and happen to survive, you must spend three days resting in a safe place per injury to heal. 3 injuries means 9 days for example.

After 3 days upon receiving injuries, you may move around and act in a debilitated capacity. You, however, retain those Injuries until you heal.

## For Referees

This is an evolving part of the section. As I test more things in the rules, I'll add things here.

## Inhuman Violence

Monstrosities are dealt with differently. For designing monsters, I usually just refer to Luke Gearing's [Inhuman Violence 2](https://lukegearing.blot.im/inhuman-violence-2).
