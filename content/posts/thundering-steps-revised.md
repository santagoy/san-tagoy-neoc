## This Is

A revision of my prior rules. I decided to make the rules for Thundering Steps simpler thanks to Brandon's work on [Chaos Reigns](https://chaoclypse.itch.io/chaos-reigns). Hopefully this makes things more accessible and easier to grok for those I play with. Now to finish that hexcrawl I've been holding off for eons now.

## Characters

You are a proud warrior of the Ten Tribes. You are assumed to be well versed in riding and caring for mounts. Additionally, firing missiles on horseback is an acquired skill you've been honing since childhood. Hunting and tracking comes naturally to you given the years of practice you've had on your great lands.

### Attributes

You begin with 2d6+4 hit points.

Thews add to attack rolls and modify damage. For feats of physical ability.

Wits modify initiative. A general measure of your aptitude.

Charisma adds to NPC reaction rolls. It increases your likelihood of being invited to a meal.

Roll a d3 or 1d4-1 for each of them. The modifiers add to a 2d6 roll. Players need an 8 or higher on the roll to succeed at difficult tasks or to save themselves from dangerous situations.

Some rolls are done with Glory: 3d6 and taking the two highest dice. Other rolls are done with Risk: 3d6, but taking the two lowest.

### Inventory

6 quick slots, can be pulled at a moment's notice. 8 rucksack slots, takes at least 5 seconds or 1d2 rounds in combat to procure.

Start with 2d4 x 100 hacksilver to purchase your equipment of choice.

You begin with a mix of 1d4+1 riding and hunting horses. The distribution between both is up to you.

Roll 1d6 to determine each horse's quality. The higher, the better.

### Beginning with Magic

Roll 1d6 + Charisma. On a 6, you begin with a contract with an Outrider, otherworldly spirits that grant their power and have their fates intertwined with their host.
  
## Skirmishes

### Sequence

1. Both sides declare actions.
2. Both sides roll 1d6 for initiative.
3. Actions are resolved in the following order:
  a. Movement
  b. Missile Fire / Magic
  c. Melee
4. Morale is checked, if required.

### Initiative

For initiative, both sides roll 1d6 + Wits.

The side that rolls higher can elect to go first or last. You can also elect to interrupt the actions of the enemy. (For example, waiting for an enemy to move to them then attacking first.)

Equal rolls means that actions occur simultaneouslyâ€”if you are killed during the round, you still get to complete your actions.

#### Three or More Sides

Fighting sides in excess of two have the order of their actions arranged from highest roll to the lowest. The highest may elect to go at any time even interrupting another side's action(s).

Equal rolls between sides still mean simultaneity.

### Actions

Humans are limited to 3 actions per round. Supernatural Creatures can act equal to their HD-1 with a minimum of 2.

Actions are limited to anything that may be done within a frame of 12 seconds.

Common Actions:

- Movement
- Attacking
- Casting Spells
- Jumping across the room via rope
- Defenestrating an enemy with a kick

### Attacking

Roll 2d6 + Thews against the target's Armor with both melee and missiles.

You must be within 3" of your target for melee.

The target numbers apply to missile fire too.

| AC  | Armor Type       | TN (2d6) |
| :-: | ---------------- | :-------: |
|  9  | Unarmored        |     6     |
|  8  | Shield           |     7     |
|  7  | Leather          |     7     |
|  6  | Leather + Shield |     8     |
|  5  | Chain            |     8     |
|  4  | Chain + Shield   |     9     |
|  3  | Plate            |     9     |
|  2  | Plate + Shield   |    10     |

#### Missile Fire

All missile weapons are two-handed.

Deduct 1 from to-hit for medium-range shots.

Deduct 2 from to-hit for long-range shots.

If you break line of sight with the enemy or are within 3" of them (in melee), they cannot shoot you.

##### Firing into Melee

If an attack misses and is less than or equal to 4, damage is dealt to an untargeted melee participant. The exact target is determined randomly.

#### Shields

Shields can be sacrificed to nullify damage from a single hit.

#### Damage

The highest die in the 2d6 attack roll is the amount of damage dealt.

Arquebuses and two-handed melee weapons roll an additional 1d6 for damage.

### Morale

Roll for morale when NPCs' leader dies or if their opponents gain a significant advantage.

| 2d6    | Reaction      |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 2--3   | Surrender     |
| 4--6   | Flee          |
| 7--10  | Hold position |
| 11--12 | Attack!       |

### On-Foot Creature Speeds

Speed is always measured in inches on the table per round.

| Creature               | Speed  |
| ---------------------- | :----: |
| In Leather or No Armor |  12"   |
| In Chain or Plate      |   9"   |
| Supernatural Beings    | 9--18" |

Supernatural Creatures' speeds depend on the specific creature encountered. Regardless, the value is always a factor of 3.

*N means a hit or damage is impossible at that range.*

### Mounted Combat

Only those of the Ten Tribes or other peoples like them can fire missiles on horseback mid-gallop and split their movement . All other fighters from other factions must slow their horse to one-third speed and fire missiles only after movement at -2.

Targeting a barded horse in melee subtracts -2 from the roll.

Strong winds or rain incur -1 to rolls.

#### Movement

Each horse type has a different speeds in a skirmish.

| Item          | Unarmored Speed | Barded Speed |
| ------------- | :-------------: | :----------: |
| Pack Horse    |       18"       |     15"      |
| Riding Horse  |       24"       |     21"      |
| Hunting Horse |       21"       |     18"      |
| War Horse     |       21"       |     18"      |
| Camel         |       18"       |     15"      |

Spurring makes the mount move up to its full movement speed additional times within the movement phase. A mount's quality, rated from 1 to 6, is the number of times it can be spurred between rests. Spurring a horse beyond its quality rating has a 3-in-6 chance of the mount collapsing to fatigue.

#### Melee

Fighters on horseback who engage in melee can no longer leave melee range lest you receive a free attack from your opponent.

You must always move first before attacking in melee. If you move closer in a straight line at full speed, spending at least a movement, you are considered charging. Charging and wielding a lance each add +1 to the roll.

#### Striking the Mount

Once a mount is struck by an attack with damage of 6+, it is no longer able to serve as an effective steed in combat and the rider must roll 2d6 + Thews to remain in the saddle. Roll with Advantage if you are from the Ten Tribes. An 8+ means you continue riding, but cannot spur the horse anymore. You take 1d6 damage from falling off the horse.

Barded mounts are harder to hit, but have their speed reduced.

| Mount     | TN  |
| --------- | :-: |
| Unarmored |  7  |
| Barded    |  9  |

## NPCs

Non-player characters only have HD (Hit Dice) which are worth 1d6 each. Always roll their HD to determine their hit points.

Humans' HD count determines their modifier to melee attacks. Their modifier to missile attacks and initiative are variable and depend on the character.

Humans only range from 1HD to 3HD.

Supernatural creatures can go greater than that. Their modifiers to attacks and initiative vary greatly across different creatures, but can be no greater than 4. Supernatural creatures always deal an additional 1d6 worth of damage, unless otherwise specified.

### NPC Reactions

Roll for when unsure how NPCs might react/respond to players.

Always roll on this table when summoning Outriders for the first time.

| 2d6 | Reaction                              |
| :-: | ------------------------------------- |
|  2  | Attack! *Curse player if an Outrider* |
|  3  | Hostile                               |
|  4  | Suspicious                            |
|  5  | Surly                                 |
