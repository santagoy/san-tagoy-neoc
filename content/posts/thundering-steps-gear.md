Chalk for writing on stone. It's common and the cost is negligible unless you're buying a sack.

Ephedra Tincture is able to rouse a man from unconsciousness or end paralysis.

Aglofotis is able to be rubbed into a wound to counter act the effects of venom or purify imbibed poison.

Monkshood is a possibly sub-lethal poison which if swallowed cools the flesh, slows the pulse and breathing to near imperceptible levels allowing the imbiber to mimic being death. Frail men risk death upon imbibing it.
