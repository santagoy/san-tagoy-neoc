## Characters

You are a proud warrior of the Ten Tribes. You are assumed to be well versed in riding and caring for mounts. Additionally, firing missiles on horseback is an acquired skill you've been honing since childhood. Hunting and tracking comes naturally to you given the years of practice you've had on your great lands.

### Attributes

You begin with 2d6+4 hit points.

Thews add to attack rolls and modify damage. For feats of physical ability.

Wits modify initiative. A general measure of your aptitude.

Charisma adds to NPC reaction rolls. It increases your likelihood of being invited to a meal.

Roll a d3 for each of them. The modifiers add to a 2d6 roll. Players need an 8 or higher on the roll to succeed at difficult tasks or to save themselves for dangerous situations.

Some rolls are done with Glory: 3d6 and taking the two highest dice. Other rolls are done with Shame: 3d6, but taking the two lowest.

### Inventory

6 quick slots, can be pulled at a moment's notice. 8 rucksack slots, takes at least 5 seconds or 1d2 rounds in combat to procure.

Start with 2d4 x 100 hacksilver to purchase your equipment of choice.

You begin with a mix of 1d4+1 riding and hunting horses. The distribution between both is up to you.

Roll 1d6 to determine each horse's quality. The higher, the better.

### Beginning with Magic

Roll 1d6 + Charisma. On a 5 or 6, you begin with a contract with an Outrider, otherworldly spirits that grant their power for an obeisance.
  
## Skirmishes

Actions are done in order of sequenced actions. The Referee calls for the actions and sequence and players announce to which action they're committing.

1. Movement
2. Melee and Missiles
3. Miscellaneous

On horseback, movement is a free action. On foot, players must decide whether they're moving, striking, shooting, or doing anything else that will occupy their turn.

Those striking in melee must be within 3" of the target. Using missiles at this range means a free attack against you.

Ranged weapons have different ranges depending on the type.

An attack hits only if it meets the target value listed on the To-Hit Tables. To know which attack hits first during Skirmishes, the highest attack sum rolled after adding Wits modifiers only is the attack that lands first. If the enemy doesn't die after the first hit, blows are exchanged and blood continues to be shed.

Miscellaneous is anything from speaking for an extended amount of time to acquiring an important piece of gear from your pack.

Lastly, characters with Thews at +3 may shoot or strike twice in a turn, unless with arquebus.

### Damage

The highest die in the 2d6 attack roll is the amount of damage dealt.

Add Thews to the damage as well.

### Fighting on Foot

This presumes completely unmounted combat. Use the [mounted combat rules]({{< ref "thundering-steps#mounted-combat">}}) if any number of combatants are on horses.

Always compare the attack roll vs armor type to know when attacks hit.

#### On Foot Creature Speeds

Speed is always measured in inches on the table.

| Creature               | Free Movement per Round |
|------------------------|:-----------------------:|
| In Leather or No Armor | 12"                     |
| In Chain or Plate      | 9"                      |
| Supernatural Beings    | 9--18"                   |

Supernatural Creatures' speeds depend on the specific creature encountered. Regardless, the value is always a factor of 3.

#### To-Hit Target Number in Melee

| Weapon Type | None | Leather | Shield | Leather + Shield | Chain | Chain + Shield | Plate | Plate + Shield |
|-------------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|:----------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|
| Light       | 6    | 7       | 8      | 8                | 9     | 10             | 12    | 12             |
| Medium      | 7    | 8       | 8      | 9                | 8     | 9              | 10    | 11             |
| Heavy       | 6    | 6       | 6      | 6                | 6     | 7              | 7     | 8              |

#### To-hit Target Numbers for Ranged Attacks

Range is divided in thirds. The target to hit depending on the range between the shooter and the combatant.

If you break line of sight with the enemy or are within 3" of them (in melee), they cannot shoot you.

Arquebuses roll an additional 1d6 for damage.

Finally, spending a whole round to aim grants a +1 to your attack roll next round.

| Ranges   | Weapon         | None  | Leather | Shield | Leather + Shield | Chain  | Chain + Shield | Plate   | Plate + Shield |
|:--------:|----------------|:-----:|:-------:|:------:|:----------------:|:------:|:--------------:|:-------:|:--------------:|
| 5/10/15" | Short Bow      | 6--7--8 | 6--7--8   | 6--7--8  | 7--8--9            | 8--9--10 | 9--10--11        | 11--12--N | 12--N--N         |
| 6/12/18" | Horse Bow      | 5--6--7 | 5--6--8   | 5--6--8  | 6--7--8            | 8--9--10 | 9--10--11        | 11--12--N | 12--N--N         |
| 6/12/18" | Light Crossbow | 5--6--7 | 5--7--8   | 5--7--8  | 6--7--9            | 8--9--10 | 10--11--N        | 11--12--N | 12--N--N         |
| 7/14/21" | Longbow        | 5--6--7 | 5--6--7   | 5--6--7  | 5--6--8            | 6--7--9  | 8--9--10         | 9--11--N  | 11--12--N        |
| 8/16/24" | Composite      | 5--6--7 | 5--6--7   | 5--6--7  | 5--7--8            | 6--8--10 | 8--10--11        | 9--12--N  | 11--N--N         |
| 8/16/24" | Heavy Crossbow | 4--5--6 | 4--6--7   | 4--6--8  | 5--7--8            | 6--8--9  | 7--9--10         | 8--10--11 | 10--11--12       |

*N means a hit or damage is impossible at that range.*

### Mounted Combat

A succesful hit is determined by the table below. 2d6, rolls equal to or above the value listed below indicate hits. If the lower die of the 2d6 is an even number, your horse is instead hit unless it has barding.

|           | 9" | 15" | 21" |
|-----------|:--:|:---:|:---:|
| Horse Bow | 9  | 10  | 11  |
| Arquebus  | 8  | 11  | N   |

The target to hit in melee while on horseback is always an 8. Targeting a barded horse in melee subtracts -2 from the role.

Characters who elect to aim rather than fire, roll with +1 on their next turn. Strong winds or rain incur -1 to rolls.

#### Initiative

Combat is still committed to the sequence stated at the start of the [Skirmish section]({{< ref "thundering-steps#skirmishes">}}) Characters may move up to their horses speed at the first phase, but must choose whether they engage a in melee, missile, or miscellaneous action.

The higher attack rolls + Wits are always the first to hit.

#### Movement

Each horse type has different speeds in a skirmish.

| Item          | Unarmored Speed | Barded Speed |
|---------------|:---------------:|:------------:|
| Pack Horse    | 18"             | 12"          |
| Riding Horse  | 24"             | 16"          |
| Hunting Horse | 21"             | 14"          |
| War Horse     | 21"             | 14"          |
| Camel         | 18"             | 12"          |

Spurring makes the mount move up to its full movement speed additional times within the movement phase. Spur mounts a specific amount of times in between rests equal to their quality. Spurring a horse beyond its quality rating has a 3-in-6 chance of the mount collapsing to fatigue.

#### Melee

Opponents on horseback who engage in melee can no longer leave melee range lest they receive a free attack from their opponent.

You must always move first before attacking in melee. If you move closer in a straight line at full speed, spending at least a movement, you are considered charging. Engaging in melee (within 3") scores a hit against the rider on rolls of 8+, charging and wielding a lance each add +1 to the roll.

#### Additional Considerations

Once a horse is struck by an arrow, it is no longer able to serve as an effective steed in combat and the rider must roll 2d6 + Thews to remain in the saddle. A 6 or higher means they continue riding, but cannot spur the horse anymore. Riders which fall from their saddle take 1d6 damage.

Barded horses can ignore 3 hits from arrows, but have their speed reduced by a third.

Those not of the Ten Tribes who engage in mounted combat, untrained in firing mid-gallop, must slow their horse to one-third speed and roll at -4 when shooting missiles.

### Mounted vs Unmounted Combat

Commit to the sequence of actions but only mounted combatants have free movement. They, however, may freely disengage from melee with opponents on foot for as long as they are not surrounded. Disengaging while surrounded by armed combatants on foot permits free attacks against the rider.

Mounted combatants in melee still cannot disengage from one another unless the first to leave receives a free attack.

#### Hitting Mounted Targets When on Foot

Consult the following tables when trying to hit mounted targets for combatants on foot.

##### In Melee

| Weapon Type | Unarmored Mounts | Barded Mount |
|-------------|:----------------:|:------------:|
| Light       | 8                | 10           |
| Medium      | 8                | 10           |
| Heavy       | 6                | 8            |

##### Wth Missiles

| Ranges   | Weapon         | Unarmored Mount | Barded Mount |
|:--------:|----------------|:---------------:|:------------:|
| 5/10/15" | Short Bow      | 10-12-N         | 12-N-N       |
| 6/12/18" | Horse Bow      | 9-10-11         | 12-N-N       |
| 6/12/18" | Light Crossbow | 9-10-N          | 12-N-N       |
| 7/14/21" | Longbow        | 7-9-12          | 9-11-N       |
| 8/16/24" | Composite      | 7-10-12         | 10-12-N      |
| 8/16/24" | Heavy Crossbow | 7-9-12          | 9-11-N       |
| 6/12/18" | Arquebus       | 6-9-11          | 8-10-12      |

## NPCs

{.half}

Non-player characters only have HD (Hit Dice) which are worth 1d6 each. Always roll their HD to determine their hit points.

Their HD count determines their Thews modifier in combat. Their Wits at -1 of their HD count. Vice versa may also be applied.

Humans only range from 1HD to 3HD. Supernatural creatures can go greater than that.

Supernatural creatures always deal an additional 1d6 worth of damage, unless otherwise specified.

### NPC Reactions

Roll for when unsure how NPCs might react/respond to players.

Always roll on this table when summoning Outriders.

| 2d6 | Reaction                              |
|:---:|---------------------------------------|
| 2   | Attack! *Curse player if an Outrider* |
| 3   | Hostile                               |
| 4   | Suspicious                            |
| 5   | Surly                                 |
| 6   | Disinterested                         |
| 7   | Neutral                               |
| 8   | Amicable                              |
| 9   | Cheerful                              |
| 10  | Friendly                              |
| 11  | Helpfuly                              |
| 12  | Treats you like family                |
