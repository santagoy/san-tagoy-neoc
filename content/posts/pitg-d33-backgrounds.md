## WELCOME TO WHAT-WAS

The Kapitol Wastes of Once Manila! I don't want to make a new system or intimidate newbies with B/X. Plus I didn't want a setting exposition dump. The solution was Troika! And, yes, I ripped the characters from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2. Then I made them into more specific backgrounds for this post. The Force even has an analog here.

The reason was that after playing Dogs in the Vineyard, I wanted to make a setting inspired by it in the post-apocalypse. So I came up with Pigs in the Graveyard. I wanted to develop over time, but now I think the best way to build the world is with Troika. Yay!

I'll be running [Smells Fishy, Jack!](https://san-tagoy.itch.io/smells-fishy-jack). Players, don't click if you want to avoid all spoilers. I'm evidently excited. Yay (1).

## 12 WELL-READ COUNCILOR

However, you've felt the call of The Howl and have let it surge through you once. You could call upon it again When you do, you sing at a frequency subtle enough to create unstable resonances that rend molecules apart. All who hear this take damage as below*. Roll luck too. On a failure, allies receive the same damage. If you choose to not roll luck, gain +1 to the damage roll.
