    TOC Utility Partial: parseHeading

    This partial parses a string containing an HTML heading element to return
    a map of the element's values.

    The return map for the heading always includes:

    - `HTML`: The raw HTML for the heading, as passed to this partial.
    - `Level`: An integer representing the heading's level. Always between one
      and six, inclusive.
    - `ID`: The `id` attribute for the heading, also known as its anchor.
    - `Text`: An HTML string representing the inner HTML for the heading. This
      string is munged to remove the Platen-added anchor element and to remove
      the wrapping `<a></a>` from any nested links in the heading, since those
      will break the TOC.
    - `Attributes`: The map of attributes passed to the heading from markup, if
      the heading was handled by Platen on a content page. This isn't populated
      if the attributes were added with `markdownify` or if the heading was
      added by a shortcode or partial that didn't call `.RenderString` on the
      page.

    This is the pattern that parses the heading's HTML. Each component of the
    pattern is explained below:

    - `<h([1-6])`

      This component looks for the opening of the heading and captures the
      heading's level.
    - `[^>]*?`

      This component looks for any number of any character except the closing
      angle bracket for the heading, with a non-greedy match, to account for
      any attributes on the heading before the `id` attribute.
    - `id="([^\x22]*)"`

      This component looks for the `id` attribute on the heading and captures its
      value. If the heading doesn't have an `id` attribute, it doesn't match.
    - `[^>]*>`

      This component looks for any number of any character except the closing
      angle bracket for the heading, to account for any attributes on the
      heading after the `id` attribute. Then it matches the closing angle
      bracket.

    - `((?:.|\s)+?)`

      This component captures all of the content inside the heading element as
      a single, non-greedy match. If the heading has no inner content, it
      doesn't match the regex.
    - `<\/h[1-6]>`

      This component matches the closing of the heading element.
