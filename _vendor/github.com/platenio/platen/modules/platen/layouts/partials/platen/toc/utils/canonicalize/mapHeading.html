    TOC Canonicalize Partial: mapHeading

    This partial processes a list of headings to build them into a map where
    child headings are added to their parent. That way, the templates can write
    the entries for the TOC without having to check whether they're closing the
    prior entries.

    The only mandatory parameter for this partial is `Headings`, which is 

    This partial expects input as a dictionary with the following keys:

    - `Headings` - the slice of parsed headings from the content before
      mapping starts. This slice isn't referenced but not modified because it
      represents the unmunged headings in the order they were discovered in
      the content.
    - `Heading` - the current heading being mapped from the caller.
    - `Parent` - A heading with at least one known child heading. This value is
      only set when processing a heading that is discovered to be a child of
      the previous heading.
    - `Previous` - The last processed heading. After processing a heading, the
      partial updates this value.
    - `Processed` = The list of processed heading IDs. This is used to prevent
      double-processing the same heading. This partial updates the value in
      place and always returns it.

    The partial iterates over the unprocessed headings list to build a map of
    headings with their children. If a later heading is discovered to be a
    child of a previous heading, it's added to that heading in the Child key
    for the heading's map.

    It recursively calls itself as needed, mapping the parent-child
    relationships for deeply nested headings.

    This partial returns output as a dictionary with the following keys:

    - `Mapped` -  The mapped Heading. This value depends on the input and
      processing results for the file.

      When the `Parent` parameter is passed, this value represents the updated
      parent heading with any discovered children.

      When the `Parent` parameter isn't passed and the processed heading is at
      the same level as the previous heading, it returns the processed heading.

      When the `Parent` parameter isn't passed and the processed heading is
      discovered to be a child of the previous heading, it recurses with the
      previous heading as the `Parent` parameter and then returns the previous
      heading with its mapped children.
    - `Processed` - The list of processed heading IDs after the partial
      finishes the current processing pass for its input.
