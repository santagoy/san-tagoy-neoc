    - mungeHeadingLevel converts a value for a heading level to between 0 and 6,
      inclusive. A value of 0 indicates that the markup shouldn't be rendered
      as a heading. If the value is less than 0, it's munged to 0. If it's
      greater than 6, it's munged to 6.

    - getLeadTrimmedText takes a block of text and trims the leading whitespace
      for the first line from the remaining lines. Use this to ensure Markdown
      in a nested codeblock can be rendered correctly.

    - getMergedClasses merges one or more default classes with a list of
      additional classes, returning the union of the two lists (no duplicate
      values). It's space-delimited by default, but you can pass Delimit as false
      to return the values as a slice.

    - getPrettyRender renders a line or block of Markdown and munges it for line
      length and indentation. You can use the AsBlock option in the parameters
      to always render the Markdown as a block, even when it's only one line.
      You can set the indent count with the IndentCount option.

    - getSafeAttributes takes a slice of HTML element attributes as strings and
      returns them as a single space-delimited string, marked as safe for
      insertion into HTML attributes.

    Canonicalize options with config defaults, using the value from the config

    Delete this section if the markup doesn't use defaults from the site config.

    It loops over the list of config options to see if they're set. Then it uses
    those values as the default for the matching value from the merged options,
    ignoring the value from config if it was set in the markup's attribute,
    options, or preset properties.

    You can check the name of the key to do specific munging if the values in
    the configuration don't match the value type for the options. Here we left
    the handling for classes, where the configuration specifies `classes` as an
    array but markup always uses `class` due to the built-in handling of class
    attributes by Hugo. It space-delimits the values from config and uses them
    as a default if `class` isn't defined in the options.

    You can do similar handling for other keys by adding an 'else if' statement
    before the end of the conditional, like:

        {{- else if (eq "use_legacy" $OptionKey) -}}
          {{- $key   = "legacy"                         -}}

    'legacy' key in the options.
