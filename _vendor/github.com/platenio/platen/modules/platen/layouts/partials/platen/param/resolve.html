{{/*
    This partial is a convenience partial to wrap calling `_resolve` and
    caching the results without requiring the caller to use a very long call.
    Without this partial, caching a resolution would look like line 57
    everywhere it's used, making for very long lines and continually repeated
    boilerplate.

    `_resolve` is used to canonically resolve a configuration option by merging
    the configuration setting from data, Hugo's configuration (files and
    environment), a page's front matter, and a default value.

    When only one key is provided for Config, the value is a deep merge of the
    key's data over configuration. When more than one key is provided for
    Config, the first key that resolves is used.

    When only one key is provided for Param, the value is pulled from the
    page's front matter. To use this option, the caller must pass the page's
    context. If the page's context isn't provided, the partial will try to use
    the current page context, if available. When more than one key is provided
    for Param, the first key that resolves is used.

    When keys for both Config and Param are provided, the value from the page's
    front matter is used if it's available. If it isn't, the value defaults to
    the deep merge of the key's data over configuration. In all cases, only the
    first resolved value is used.

    When a Default is provided, the value is set to the Default only if the
    value would otherwise be nil.

    For example, consider this input:

        dict "Config" (slice "display.foo.bar" "display.foo_bar")
             "Param"  (slice "foo.bar" "foo_bar")
             Context  page
             Default  false
    
    In this case, the values resolve in the following order, returning the
    first value from this list that does resolve to a value.

    - foo.bar in the page front matter
    - foo_bar in the page front matter
    - display.foo.bar in the site config
    - display.foo_bar in the site config
    - false

    The default value false is only returned if all other lookups fail to
    resolve to a value.
