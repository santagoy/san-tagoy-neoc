    TOC Canonicalize Partial: mapToList

    This partial converts the dictionary of mapped headings with their children
    into the correctly ordered slice of headings, so they can be looped over
    when rendering the TOC.

    This partial expects to receive input as a dictionary as with the following
    keys:

    - `HeadingIDs` - The list of IDs for the mapped headings.
    - `FoundHeadings` - The slice of parsed headings in the order they were
      found in the processed content. This order is used as the canonical
      ordering for the headings.
    - `MappingHeadings` - The map of headings with their children. The key for
      the top level map is always the ID of the heading it represents. For
      headings with the Children key, defined, the value is always a map of
      headings with their ID as the key.

    This partial iterates over the found headings in the order they appeared in
    the content, looking for the matching ID in the mapping headings. If the
    IDs match, that heading will be added to the slice.
    
    Before adding the heading to the slice, the partial checks to see if the
    heading has any child headings. If it does, the partial recurses, using the
    child headings as the value for MappingHeadings.

    After the children for a heading are recursively resolved, the heading is
    added to the canonical slice.

    This partial returns a slice where each entry is a heading map and the
    entries are in the order the headings appeared in the content. If the
    heading has children, they are represented as a slice of headings in the
    correct order. Children are recursively resolved.
