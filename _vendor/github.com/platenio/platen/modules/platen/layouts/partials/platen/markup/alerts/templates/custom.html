    These values are passed to the custom template by Platen when canonicalizing
    the markup. They include:

    Attributes
        The list of attributes that Platen would've passed to the sl-alert
        element. You can parse this or reuse it.
    Content
        The pre-rendered content from the markup's definition.
    Classes
        The canonicalized list of classes for the alert. It includes the
        default class "platen-alert" as well as any classes specified in the
        markup. It's passed here as a space-separated list.
    Page
        The hugo Page variable for the Markdown page the alert markup was found
        in. You can use this to render content.
    Position
        The path to the file the alert markup was found in, as well as the line
        and column number where the codeblock started. Useful for error and
        warning messages.
    Config
        The configuration settings for platen.markup.tabs, merging them from
        both the Hugo configuration file(s) and the _params data folder.
    Options
        The canonicalized options for the markup. Platen has already merged
        the settings from the markup's attributes and YAML options and the
        preset, if specified. If the same options were set in multiple places,
        the preset values are overridden by attributes and attributes by the
        yaml options.

    Always pass the values meant to be insertable directly in the HTML through
    safeHTML, safeHTMLAttr (for attributes), safeCSS, safeJS, or safeURL so
    your values aren't munged unexpectedly.
