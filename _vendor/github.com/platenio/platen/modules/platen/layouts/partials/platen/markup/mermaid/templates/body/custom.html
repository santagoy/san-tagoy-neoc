    These values are provided from the canonicalize partial. They've been
    pre-validated for you where possible.

    Always pass the values meant to be insertable directly in the HTML through
    safeHTML, safeHTMLAttr (for attributes), safeCSS, safeJS, or safeURL so
    your values aren't munged unexpectedly.

    Container is the configured HTML element tag name to add the Mermaid graph
    definition inside. You can use that setting or ignore it.

    Definition is the Mermaid graph definition, trimmed and ready for insertion.
    You want to make sure there's no leading space on the line for a directive,
    or Mermaid breaks. Always add the Definition without indentation.

    MermaidClasses is the list of passed classes with `mermaid` added at the
    beginning of the list so the script can render it.

    Options is the list of merged, validated, and munged options available for
    the markup.

    Page is the Hugo page object for where this markup is being rendered.

    Position is the Hugo-provided position for where the markup was used in the
    Markdown file.
