    Shoelace Utility Partial: updateUsedIconLibraries

    This partial expects to receive a dict with the following keys:

    - Library: The name of the canonicalized icon library to register as being
      used on this page.
    - Page: The page the icon is being rendered on. Default's to the current
      page if not specified.

    It retrieves the `_usedIconLibraries` key from the page's store and adds
    the icon library to that list if it's not already included in it.

    If the list doesn't exist, it creates it with the input library as the only
    item in the list.

    This partial doesn't return any output.
