    TOC Canonicalize Partial: headings

    This partial converts a slice of parsed headings into a canonicalized slice
    of headings with their children defined as a slice of parsed headings. It
    handles nested child headings.

    This partial expects to receive input as a dictionary with the following
    keys:

    - `Headings` - The slice of parsed headings for a content page in the order
      they were discovered in the content.

    This partial loops over the headings, calling the mapHeading partial for
    each heading. After a heading is processed, the partial updates the list of
    processed headings. When the mapHeading partial is called again, the
    parameters include the updated list of processed headings and the result
    from the last call as the `Previous` parameter. It always passes the
    current heading in the loop for the `Heading` parameter.

    The partial records the results in a map with the heading's ID as the key
    for itself. This ensures the partial can update a previously mapped heading
    if the next heading is actually a child heading.

    After fully mapping the headings, this partial canonicalizes the map of
    headings into a slice in the same order the headings were discovered in,
    but now with any child headings added under the Children key in their
    parent heading's map.

    This partial returns the canonicalized slice of heading maps.
